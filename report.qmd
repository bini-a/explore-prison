### Introduction & Motivation

The United States is home to the largest prison population in the world. 
Consequently, incarceration is a major subject in policy and in public
discourse. Drug use among prisoners is a topic that demands attention because it
ties into an interconnected web of social and health issues. Drug-related crimes
are a major contributor not only to the prison population itself, but to the
well-documented racial disparities in incarceration and sentencing. Substance 
abuse is prevalent among prisoners and is often linked to other mental health
problems.

In this project, we aimed to investigate patterns in drug use among American
prisoners, and to develop a shiny app that allows anyone to easily visualize
drug use among subpopulations of their choosing. We wanted to create a
tool that could inform the general public, while also allowing interested
parties to easily perform some exploratory analysis. Ultimately, this tool 
could be used to discover new patterns that may warrant further research,
or to identify populations most at risk from certain drugs.

### Data

We sourced data from the 2016 Survey of Prison Inmates (SPI), a large, 
cross-sectional study conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. We
chose this dataset because it is a large, rigorous study with a sample size of
24,848 prisoners, and because it contains variables of interest including
demographic characteristics, type of crime, and a number of drug-related 
variables. Additionally, this is a periodic study with standardized questions
over time, which would allow us to extend this architecture to different time
periods in the future.

## Data Cleaning

We selected variables corresponding to prisoner age, race, sex, highest 
educational attainment before being incarcerated, and the type of crime for
which they were convicted. We also selected variables that indicated whether
the prisoner had used a certain drug (alcohol, marijuana, heroin, or 
cocaine) within a certain time period (at arrest, within 30 days of arrest,
within 1 year of arrest, or ever).

We renamed the columns and recoded the values. We created and applied functions
to add the new variables `drug_type` and `time_of_use` based on the values of
the drug variables. Specifically, `drug_type` gives which type of drug a
prisoner has used in their lifetime, and `time_of_use` gives the last time
they used any drug out of alcohol, marijuana, heroin, or cocaine. We also
opted to use a categorical `Age_group` variable based on age. Finally, we added
columns that indicated whether a prisoner had used any drug in their lifetime
or within 1 year of arrest. This would allow us to visualize overall drug use.

Additionally, for purposes of the visualizations, we omitted a couple of 
demographic categories that were exceptionally small. Specifically, we 
excluded the "Other" race category, which had only 7 people, and the "under 18"
age category, which had 37. The small size of these subsets relative to the 
overall sample severely limits the insight we can gain on them, so we decided to
focus on the other race and age groups. 

For our geographic analysis and mapping, we wanted to focus on states, and thus
we filtered to only include the 50 US states. This meant excluding some
respondents from Washington, DC and Puerto Rico. We further omitted prisoners
who were missing demographic information.

### Developing the Shiny App

We aimed to develop a Shiny app that would offer many options for self-directed
exploration of the data, while remaining intuitive and simple enough to be 
helpful for any user.

We divided the visualizations into two main sections: the demographics and drug
use sections. Since these two sections serve different purposes and require 
different inputs, we implemented a Shiny Dashboard UI to place them in 
separate tabs. We also used Shiny Dashboard features to create a collapsible
side menu for navigating between the visualization tabs. We also included
an introductory tab explaining the data and the purpose of the app.

The demographics section allows users to visualize a selected demographic
category within the prison population overall. They may also visualize
the type of crime committed. This section allows users to familiarize themselves with the general characteristics of prisoners, as well as providing crucial
context for the demographic categories they will explore in the drug use tab.
We determined than we could effectively communicate this data by offering
both a bar and pie chart, which the user can switch between. Both of these visualizations are commonly understood and easy to interpret. The pie chart
makes it easy to see the proportion of each demographic. The bar chart, on the other hand, is preferable for seeing counts, which we emphasize by displaying
the count above each bar.

The drug use tab is the most interactive. It enables users to thoroughly
compare drug use across states and demographics, using 3 different plots. The
sidebar includes dropdown selections for age, sex, race, education, and the
type of crime. The data is reactively filtered, and users can pick as many
or as few filters as they like. Thus, they can select the exact group they're
interested in and visualize multiple aspects of drug use among that group. In
the main panel, we used tabset tabs to organize the plots. This allows each plot
to be viewed individually at a large size, and lets you easily switch between 
plots while keeping the filter selections intact.

The first plot gives an overview of which drugs prisoners in the selected group
have used in their life. The second plot shows the time of their most recent
drug use. This is a meaningful addition because it helps distinguish
current/regular drug use from having ever used drugs. For both of these
visualizations, we once again provided a choice between bar and pie chart. Here,
the bar chart is imperative because the issue of small demographic subsets (which will be discussed further in "Limitations") necessitates providing some context about the raw counts.

The third plot provides a map of the United States and allows for comparisons
across states. Two additional dropdowns allow the user to pick any of the four
drugs to visualize the usage of, and to select a time period of 12 months or
lifetime. This is an approximation of "lifetime users" versus "current users at time of arrest". An all option is also included with the drugs, facilitating
comparisons of total drug use rates. The state map uses a color gradient to
represent the proportion of prisoners in the selected demographic
who used a certain drug, for each state. We chose this style of plot 
because it communicates geographic information in a very immediate and visual
way. We also believe this visualization, in combination with the fully 
user-controlled filters, is engaging and encourages exploration.

The image below previews how the app looks to users and demonstrates the 
organized layout, with a hierarchy of dashboard tabs and tabset tabs. The full
app can be run from the `shiny_app.R` file.

The flexibility in filtering and visualizations gives users the power to 
quickly explore some interesting questions about the data. For a simple example,
we might want to compare the drugs used by 25-34 year olds on the basis of sex:

![An example chart for young men](data/demo2.png)
![An example chart for young women](data/demo3.png)

From this quick comparison, we can observe a striking interest in marijuana
use between 25-34 year old males and females. Although our tool cannot
illuminate the causes of this difference, this is one of many possible
research ideas we might come up with while using this exploratory tool.

### Limitations

Our approach has some notable limitations. The most significant limitation is 
the small sample sizes of some demographic subsets. Although we intended to
build a comprehensive tool to analyze any combination of demographic traits,
stacking two or more demographic filters can excessively narrow the population 
if these filters include relatively smaller groups. These include the age 
groups 18-24 and 55+; the American Indian/Alaska Native and Asian American/
Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander groups; college-educated prisoners; and the 
"other" crime category.

Issues with narrow subsets are by far most pronounced in the state map. Many 
demographic combinations only exist in a limited number of states, which will
cause the rest to be greyed out. This can happen even with just one demographic
filter. Perhaps more concerningly, for states that do have prisoners from a narrow
demographic, the map can be misleading when viewed on its own, because it relies
solely on proportions. 

To illustrate the concerns with small demographic subsets, let's examine the
state map for all drug use in the past 12 months, filtering for only Asian &
Pacific Islander inmates:

```{r, echo =  FALSE}

df_aapi_ex = df %>%
  filter(Race == "Asian/Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander") %>%
        select(State, used_any_12months) %>%
      group_by(State) %>%
      summarize(percent_use = 100 * mean(used_any_12months == 1))

    df_aapi_ex$State = str_to_lower(
      state.name[match(df_aapi_ex$State, state.abb)])
    
    df_aapi_ex = left_join(map_data, df_aapi_ex, by = c("region" = "State"))
    
    ggplot(df_aapi_ex, aes(
      x = long,
      y = lat,
      group = group,
      fill = percent_use
    )) +
      geom_polygon() +
      theme_void() +
      scale_fill_distiller(palette = "RdBu",
                           direction = 1,
                           name = "% Use") +
      coord_fixed(1.3)
```

We can see that many states had no AAPI prisoners at all in the sample. 
Furthermore, from this plot alone, a user could reach some strange conclusions. 
They might think that all AAPI prisoners in Mississippi, Alabama, Iowa, and
Oklahoma were using drugs, while in many other states, no prisoners were using
drugs! In reality, this is simply due to the limited number of AAPI prisoners
in the dataset and their distribution among 50 different states. We hope that
the inclusion of bar charts will help users to see this context. Nonetheless, we could ensure users do not misinterpret the map by incorporating the counts into
it or displaying a cautionary message when the user has selected a sparse 
subgroup.

### Conclusion

We were able to leverage SPI data to build a user-friendly Shiny app with
highly interactive visualizations. We believe this could be a useful tool
for sparking public interest in the relationship between drug use and 
incarceration in the US. It can also serve as an exploratory tool to
highlight possible research questions. However, it is significantly limited
by the small size of some filtered subsets, particularly in terms of the 
geographical analysis.
